Wow, it's been quite a minute since I last posted here. A lot has happened, and a lot is happening... Today I explain why I've been MIA for quite some time, and why I'm packing up to move to the other side of the country. <!-- excerpt -->

Before we get started, here's a bit of a preview of what you're in for before you read ahead. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, so I figured I'd put this first.

- Taking a break and focusing on work
- Tourette's and Disability
- OCD and Near-Death Experiences
- Becoming a home-owner and moving to Canberra
  - Starting an FRC team
  - Starting an FRC company

## Taking a break and focusing on work
Almost three years ago now, I was minding my own business when a student of mine forwarded me a post on Chief Delphi - ["Are Jaci and Her Pathfinder Gone?"](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/are-jaci-and-her-pathfinder-gone/381141/1). My reply in that thread says pretty much everything - I took some time away from FRC, and basically everything else, to focus on myself and my career. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made, and I'd make it again and again if need be. 

That focus on my education and my career has continuted to this day. Last year, I graduated University with a double bachelor, with all the trimmings. Since then, I've rised to one of the most senior technical positions at work and loving every minute of it. On top of that, I've kept a more healthy relationship with FRC - less obsessive, more deliberate, and more balanced. I still sometimes wish I could do more, but it's an unceasing act to try and moderate yourself and be content. 

That being said, I didn't exactly slow to a crawl. In 2021, myself and the Perth FRC crowd started our first ever offseason in the most isolated capital city on the planet, Perth - my home. It remains one of my proudest achievements, and running it every year is a blast. We're treasured to be able to run things a little differently to suit our environment and "WA Vibe", as well as the unique background of a lot of our constituents. I truly believe it's a unique event, and that's in part due to the insane amount of legwork our volunteers put in. Kudos.

Another little tidbit is that I started volunteering elsewhere, primarily with our state ambulance service as a Medic (well, Event Ambulance Officer technically, but I understand that term doesn't translate to other parts of the world). I learnt a lot and it was a good chance to get out of my comfort zone and practice skills I had never developed before. Really, I loved it and I'd recommend it in a heartbeat if you don't mind a bit of blood (and occasionally vomit). Being able to help people when they're truly in need is a unique but profound privilege. 

## Tourette's and Disability
If you know me in real life, there's a good chance you know that I have something called Tourette's Syndrome (TS) - a rare neurological disorder that results in involuntary tics that can be painful and unexpected. I was diagnosed when I was 7, but it's fluctuated my whole life - some years it gets really bad, some years it's barely noticeable. In case you haven't guessed, these last few years belong to the former category.

About 2.5 years ago, my TS started getting really bad. I would get breathing tics that interrupted my breathing pattern, my neck would snap back in a sudden and painful motion, and most pertinently, I started to develop tics in my left leg. The tics in my leg were so painful that it felt like my knee was going to give out. My leg never got any rest, so it always felt like I had just finished a 400m sprint. The tics would come in the middle of a walking cycle, throwing me off my balance and eventually to the ground. 

I tried to keep it under wraps for a long time, but eventually I started using a walking stick part-time. That part-time turned into full-time, and that full-time turned into using a wheelchair on the worst of days and my cane on the best. As a 23 year old, I got quite antsy about using my cane in public - it felt like everyone was staring at me and I would get all up in my own head about what they thought of me. Nowadays it's just my normal, and I can't imagine myself without it. I've come to depend on it just like I do my right leg. 

Coping with this semi-new disability was hard. "What no one tells you about disability is that it's the only minority group _anyone_ can become a part of at _any time_". It took a lot out of me, and before I knew it I was in the doctor's office multiple times a week to cope with not only this but everything else I've been blessed (?) with in terms of medical history. It really slowed me down, and learning to cope with not being able to do what you used to is beyond difficult. I miss playing volleyball, and I miss walking my dogs. But hey, think of the parking!

## OCD and Near-Death Experiences
I've always been a bit obsessive, but it took an intentional self-inflicted near-death experience<sup>1</sup> last year to make me realise that this, and many other things, were clinical. Despite what popular culture would have you believe, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) isn't just clinical perfectionism - it's a whole collection of anxiety-producing obsessions that are temporarily eased by compulsions; some of which can be harmful.

I didn't notice the signs anywhere near early enough, mostly because I didn't know what it actually was. Looking back, there are lots of parts of my life that have been affected by OCD. In some cases, it's a positive - a relentless drive, the ability to become really focused on particular tasks, and usually performing them to quite a good quality. But then there's the bad - the classic checking the locks, the obsession with contamination, the constant mental review, and unfortunately, intrusive thoughts. The compulsion in this case, of course, is to think on it more - to give the thought validity and room to grow and fester<sup>2</sup>. These thoughts come in many shapes and sizes, some more disturbing than others, but it's a different journey for everyone<sup>3</sup>. 

I suppose, in a way, OCD is similar to Tourette's. You see, in Tourette's the tics are usually accompanied by an urge - it feels almost like you're holding in a sneeze. You only have so much control of it, but you have to let it out eventually. To me, I think of the obsession like that urge - and the compulsion the tic that follows. It is not a surprise, then, that the comorbidity rate of Tourette's and OCD is very high.

You can hopefully see how OCD coupled with new-found disability was enough to throw my life off course. But why am I writing it here, out for the world to see? Well, the truth is because I want to get it out in the hopes it helps someone else. Shortly after, I started seeing the Perth OCD clinic, and it remains one of the best decisions I've made. Really, I'm doing much better now and have the coping skills to live with it. I can't recommend seeing a specialist like them highly enough. It's been 5 months and I've never been happier. Make no mistake, it'll be hard, but it'll be worth it.

## Becoming a home-owner and moving to Canberra
And so the next chapter in the story begins. I'm happy to say that I am in the process of purchasing a house! There is a catch, of course, in that it's on the other side of the country. After a lot of thought, I've decided to move to the nation's capital - Canberra, both to focus on my work and spend more time with my partner. This does, of course, mean that I'm going to be missing my FRC team, but that's where the other news comes in: I'll be starting an FRC team while I'm over there, too. I'm not sure where yet, it's still in the early stages, but I've got big plans and I can't wait for them to manifest. It'll be weird looking at the team I've come to call home on the other side of the glass. 

I've also decided to sink some time into getting my old ideas of an FRC company off the ground. You can expect to learn more about the launch of Grapple in the coming months, including some exciting products that I've been working on for some time. 

Back on the topic of the cross-country move, I'm sure it will have its challenges but I'm overall quite excited for the opportunity. I'll still be travelling back to Perth at least a few times a year, so I won't be a complete stranger to my closest people, but I'm hoping this new chapter is fruitful and has a lot in store. To new beginnings!

<sup>1</sup> I'm sure you can read between the lines here

<sup>2</sup> One obsession may actually have many different compulsions - and they don't always make sense, in fact, they usually don't. This is just an example from my experience, but others may have different compulsions.

<sup>3</sup> Uniquely, intrusive thoughts in OCD are egodystonic - meaning the person having the thoughts both doesn't want them, and is aware of the perhaps disturbing nature of some thoughts in particular. It's for this reason that people with OCD who experience intrusive thoughts don't act on nor have the intention of acting on them.
