- Make some form of automatic updater for the cluster
  - On-prem CI/CD? Security implications?
  - Webhook from GitHub Actions that triggers a `./deploy.sh --version-auto`
  - Another git remote that automatically runs the install when pushed to it?
    - Could make our own registry aside from GCR...
    - Gitlab?
    - Could be generic enough for other projects - curtincourses etc get their own helm instance with a unified traefik LB.
      - Looks like I need a staging server...
